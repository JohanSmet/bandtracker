# BandTracker

BandTracker was my final project for the Udacity iOS Developer NanoDegree I completed in [2015](https://confirm.udacity.com/E4E9UYCL). The goal was to develop iOS app of our own design that showcases the iOS development chops picked up the in the online course. The app should demonstrate solid proficiency in these four areas:

- Building sophisticated and polished user interfaces with UIKit components
- Downloading data from network resources
- Persisting state on the device
- Researching and integrating new libraries 

I created BandTracker, an app that helps you keep track of which bands you've seen live and whether you liked them or not. I might sound silly but after a few years of frequenting gigs and festivals it does get hard remembering everything ... at least that's been my experience.

There's a [design document](docs/design_document.pdf) in the `docs` subdirectory. Not everything in the document has been implemented. Mostly due to time constraints and difficulty obtaining enough usable test data.

After the NanoDegree was over I also wrote an Android version of the app. You'll find this in the android subdirectory. Both the iOS and Android apps have been compiled and checked recently (early 2019) and work with current versions of their respective development environments and libraries.

I briefly considered actually building it out and releasing the app to the wild. But the required effort and potential cost of acquiring and maintaining usable data (band biographies, tour dates, ...) soon changed my mind. Still, seeing what I learned during the development of the apps, the server and the management component, I consider it time well invested!
