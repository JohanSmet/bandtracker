        <h1>BandTracker - Help</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Have you ever looked at the poster of a music festival wondering which bands you've already seen and which ones you liked? Use <i>BandTracker</i> to keep track of live performances you've been to and how you rate them.</p>
        
        <h2>Quick Walkthrough</h2>
        
        <h3>The main screen</h3>
        <p>The "Bands"-page on the main screen lists the bands you've seen and the average rating you've given them. This list is still empty the first time you open the app, use the '+' button on the top of the screen to add bands to the list.</p>
        <p>The "Timeline"-page display a chronological list of all the gigs you've entered into the app.</p>
        
        <h3>Adding bands</h3>
        <p>After pressing the '+' button you can search for bands you want to add by entering a partial name. The app searches the BandTracker-server for any matches. Tap the band you're looking for and you'll be taken to the detail page. At the moment the server focuses on contemporary English-speaking metal and rock bands but this will be extended in the future.</p>
        <p>Can't find a band? Please let us now and we'll do our best to add them to the database.</p>
        
        <h3>Adding Gigs</h3>
        <p>Besides showing a picture of the band and a short biography the detail page of a band lets you add gigs to the list. Just press the '+'-button in the center of the screen.</p>
        <p>The BandTracker-server has tour date information for major bands. If that's the case for the band you've chosen the app shows you the guided creation screen. You can choose the year and optionally filter the list on country. Choose a gig from the list at the bottom of the screen and you'll be taken to the detail-page of the gig with all the available information already filled in. Enter your rating, and an optional comment, and press "Save" to add the gig to the list.</p>
        <p>If the server does not have tour information you can of course still add the gig, but you'll have to fill in the information yourself. The app tries to facilitate this process by suggesting cities and venues that you've already entered on other gigs.
